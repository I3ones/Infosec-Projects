# Phishing Campaign Templates
Created by: Michael Vargas

This repository is a compilation of HTML and CSS templates I have created and used to for approved security awareness campaigns/Training. The templates are used in a controlled and ethical environment as part of my role as a Student Security Analyst. Their purpose is to help users recognize phishing attempts and improve overall cybersecurity awareness.

The mock phishing pages are designed to look like common phishing scenarios so users can learn what to watch for in real attacks. These simulations help our school reduce risk by training our users in a safe and authorized setting.

The project uses only HTML and CSS and does not include any backend systems or data collection. No real credentials or sensitive information are collected or stored at any time.

All templates in this repository are used only with explicit authorization for educational and defensive purposes. They are not intended for real phishing attacks or unauthorized testing.
